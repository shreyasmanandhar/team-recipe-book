    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>200g biscuits (crushed)</li>
        <li>100g butter (melted)</li>
        <li>600g cream cheese (softened)</li>
        <li>150g sugar</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>200ml sour cream</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 160°C (320°F) and grease a 23cm springform pan. We want a smooth, non-stick base.</li>
        <li>Mix the crushed biscuits with melted butter and press it firmly into the pan to form the base.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, beat the cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla until smooth and creamy. There should be no lumps.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing gently after each. Treat it like a delicately.</li>
        <li>Fold in the sour cream until everything is beautifully combined.</li>
        <li>Pour this mixture over your biscuit base, spreading it evenly.</li>
        <li>Bake for 50–60 minutes. The center should jiggle slightly like a pudding.</li>
        <li>Turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool inside for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate for at least 4 hours (or overnight) before slicing. Patience is the key in this recipe.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Cooking time: 1 hour 15 minutes + chilling</p>
    <p>Serves: Generally 8 people (but depends on who's eating)</p>
